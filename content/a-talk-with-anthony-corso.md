Anthony Corso is a post-doctorate researcher at the [Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory](http://sisl.stanford.edu/ "Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory"), a.k.a. SISL, pronounced "sizzle" :). He wrote his [PhD thesis](http://anthonylcorso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thesis.pdf "PhD thesis") about algorithms for black-box safety validation of autonomous vehicles, he's the executive director of the [Stanford Center for AI Safety](http://aisafety.stanford.edu/ "Stanford Center for AI Safety"), he wrote a deep reinforcement learning framework in Julia, and I recently got the chance to speak with him.
